# SOLID Principles and Top Design Patterns

## Introduction

### What are Design Patterns and why do we need them?

#### What are they?

- Desing patterns are well tested, reusable solution.
- They are like a <u>solution template</u> for how to solve common software engineer ploblems.
- They are flexible and adaptable.
- They save time because they are optimal.

#### Why use them?

- You know that you are using something that has been utilized successfully in countless projects before.
- They are like a common meta-language for developers. If you and I both know what a **Singleton Pattern** is then we already have a common understanding of everything about how it would be used or how it should be implemented. You can think of a pattern as a common vocabulory for architects.
- In other words we are on the same page. And this is powerful.
- If you understand a pattern in a general manner, then you know that regardless of the language implementation, it will effectively offer the same useful solution.

#### Summary

- Design Patterns are associated with good, well organized Software Design.
- As developers, we are prone to mistakes and sometimes inexperienced decisions.
- Think of design patterns as a bag of reusable experience from many generation of coders and Software Engineers.

*Here are the patterns that we will are going to learn:*

1. Creational
   - Singleton Pattern
   - Factory Method Pattern
   - Builder Pattern

**Creational Design Patterns** are design patterns that manage **object creation** mechanisms. They are desinged to create **objects** in flexible and highly adaptable ways. These patterns offer the most reusable and flexible ways of creating object instances.

2. Structural
   - Adapter Pattern

**Structural Design Patterns** are design patterns that <u>improves</u> and <u>simplify</u> your designs by identifying the most <u>most efficient</u> and <u>reusable</u> way to composing relationships among entities. <u>This allows for the best and most efficient ways of creating complex hierarchies of objects.</u>

3. Behavioral
   - Strategy Pattern
   - Observer Pattern
   - State Pattern

**Behavioral Design Patterns** are design patterns that <u>imporves interation</u> and <u>communication</u> between objects. These patterns offer **<u>loosely coupled</u>** ways of allowing objects to talk to each other and exchange messages.

Once you master these patterns you will immediately see the world of coding differently. <u>You will start seeing those patterns everywhere.</u>

*Just remember these pattern families:*

**Creational:** Deals with wasy of creating objects or families of objects.

**Structural:** Deals with wasy of managing complex objects hierarchies.

**Behavioral:** Deals with wasy of identifying and improving object messaging.
